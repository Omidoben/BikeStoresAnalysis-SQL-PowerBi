### Recommendations

I made the following recommendations to the Bike stores company in order for them to maximize sales and revenue:
- The company should acknowledge and reward top spenders through Offer exclusive perks, personalized discounts, or early access to new products to encourage continued high spending.
- Capitalize on the success in New York by tailoring marketing strategies to appeal to the local customer base.For regions like Texas and California, explore targeted marketing campaigns to increase customer engagement and sales.
-  Reevaluate products that have been sold only once. Consider discontinuing or revising these products based on customer feedback or market demand.
- Plan promotions and marketing initiatives around the high-sales months of April and March. Consider special holiday promotions for December and November to boost sales during traditionally slower periods.
